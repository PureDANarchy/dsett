        <p>
          I was born in Tucson, Arizona. I have two dogs and one cat. I am married to a beautiful woman named Jaclyn.
          My hobbies include: Video games, Music, Golfing, Web Designing, and Hiking. For five years, I have been a <a href="https://www.sdmlguitar.com/dan-settle">music teacher</a>; teaching a variety of stringed instruments.
          I decided to stop that to pursue my career in Cybersecurity. I hope to graduate with honors in the summer of two-thousand and twenty four.
